Amazon Web Automation Framework
This is a robust test automation framework designed to validate the functionality of the Amazon e-commerce website. It is built using Java, Selenium, TestNG, and Cucumber, following industry-best practices like Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) and the Page Object Model (POM).

✨ Features
This framework covers a wide range of test scenarios for key user journeys on the Amazon platform.

Key Test Areas:
Product Search:

Valid search using both the search button and the Enter key.

Search functionality within specific departments (e.g., Electronics).

Autocomplete search suggestions and selection.

Edge cases, including empty, invalid, and very long search queries.

User Authentication:

Positive and negative login flows with valid and invalid credentials.

Session persistence validation while navigating the site.

User Registration:

Validation of mandatory fields on the registration form.

End-to-End Purchase Flow:

A complete negative-path scenario that tests the system's error handling for invalid payment details during checkout.

Home Page UI Validation:

Verification of critical UI elements like the company logo and promotional banners.

Health checks to detect broken images and links on the home page.

🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites
Java (JDK 11 or higher)

Apache Maven

Setup & Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone <your-repository-url>

Navigate to the project directory:

cd <project-directory>

Install dependencies:
Maven will automatically download all the required project dependencies defined in pom.xml.

mvn clean install

🧪 How to Run Tests
Tests can be executed either from the command line using Maven or directly from an IDE.

Command Line Execution
Run the entire test suite as defined in testng.xml:

mvn clean test

Running from an IDE
Simply right-click on the testng.xml file and select "Run '.../testng.xml'".

📊 Reporting
The framework generates multiple, comprehensive reports after each test run to provide detailed insights into the execution results.

Extent Reports:

Rich, interactive HTML reports with detailed test steps, status, and embedded screenshots.

Location: test-output/ExtentReport_Dashboard.html and test-output/ExtentReport_Tests.html.

Cucumber Reports:

Standard BDD reports generated by Cucumber.

Location: target/cucumber.html.

Excel Reports:

A simple summary of test results is created in an Excel file, with hyperlinks to the corresponding screenshots for quick debugging.

Location: test-output/TestResults.xlsx.

⚙️ Configuration
The framework's behavior can be easily configured by modifying the files in src/test/resources/.

config.properties: Change the baseUrl, browser, and test user credentials here.

testdata.xlsx: Modify or add test data for your data-driven scenarios (e.g., add new products to search for).

testng.xml: Modify the test suite to run specific classes or pass parameters to your tests.
